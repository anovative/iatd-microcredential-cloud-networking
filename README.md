# IATD Microcredential: Cloud Networking

## Course Overview

This microcredential course provides comprehensive hands-on labs for cloud networking across Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The course is structured around six key learning outcomes, each focusing on different aspects of cloud networking, from core infrastructure to advanced hybrid networking concepts.

## Learning Outcomes

- Basic Network Connectivity

**Labs:** 9 core labs + capstone lab + supplementary labs for AWS and GCP

### [Learning Outcome 2: Design and Implement Advanced Network Infrastructure](learning_outcome_2/README.md)

Build upon core networking concepts to implement advanced network infrastructure components.

**Key Topics:**
- User-Defined Routes
- System Routes
- BGP Configuration

- Advanced Network Topologies

**Labs:** 15 core labs + capstone lab + supplementary labs for AWS and GCP

### [Learning Outcome 3: Network Security and Access Control](learning_outcome_3/README.md)

Implement comprehensive network security solutions to protect cloud resources.

**Key Topics:**
- Network Security Groups (NSGs)
- Application Security Groups (ASGs)
- DDoS Protection
- Network Monitoring and Logging
- Security Policies

**Labs:** 6 core labs + capstone lab + supplementary labs for AWS and GCP

### [Learning Outcome 4: Service Integration and Network Design](learning_outcome_4/README.md)

Design and implement service integration patterns and network designs for cloud applications.

**Key Topics:**
- Service Endpoints
- Private Endpoints
- Service Integration Patterns

**Labs:** 11 core labs + capstone lab + supplementary labs for AWS and GCP

### [Learning Outcome 5: Load Balancing and Hybrid Connectivity](learning_outcome_5/README.md)

Implement load balancing solutions and hybrid connectivity options in cloud environments.

**Key Topics:**
- Azure Load Balancer
- Application Gateway
- Azure Front Door
- Site-to-Site VPNs
- ExpressRoute

**Labs:** 6 core labs + capstone lab + supplementary labs for AWS and GCP

### [Learning Outcome 6: Advanced Hybrid Networking and Network Operations](learning_outcome_6/README.md)

Implement advanced hybrid networking solutions and network operations practices.

**Key Topics:**
- Multi-Cloud Networking
- Network Monitoring and Diagnostics
- Network Performance Optimization
- Network Automation
- Network Operations Best Practices

**Labs:** 15 core labs + capstone lab + supplementary labs for AWS and GCP

## Lab Conventions

All labs in this microcredential follow these conventions:

### Naming Conventions
- Resource names follow a consistent pattern for easy identification
- Each lab has a unique prefix for resources

### IP Addressing
- The `172.16.0.0/16` range is used consistently across all labs
- Subnets follow a consistent pattern within this range

### Lab Structure
- **Objective:** Clear statement of lab goals
- **Prerequisites:** Required knowledge and resources
- **Step-by-Step Instructions:** Detailed guidance with expected outputs
- **Verification Steps:** Methods to confirm successful implementation
- **Cleanup Instructions:** Comprehensive steps to remove resources

### Multi-Cloud Approach
- Core labs focus on Azure
- Supplementary labs provide equivalent implementations in AWS and GCP
- Capstone labs integrate concepts across all three cloud platforms

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Cloud Accounts:**
   - Microsoft Azure Subscription
   - Amazon Web Services (AWS) Account
   - Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Account

2. **Tools:**
   - Azure CLI
   - AWS CLI
   - Google Cloud SDK
   - PowerShell or Bash shell

3. **Knowledge:**
   - Basic understanding of networking concepts
   - Familiarity with cloud computing fundamentals

### How to Use This Repository
