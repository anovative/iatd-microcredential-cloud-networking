## Troubleshooting Guide

If you encounter issues during the labs, here are some common problems and their solutions:

1. **NSG Rule Issues:**
   - Verify rule priorities (lower numbers have higher priority)
   - Check source and destination settings
   - Ensure protocol and port settings match your requirements
   - Verify NSG is correctly associated with subnet or NIC

2. **ASG Issues:**
   - Confirm VMs are correctly associated with ASGs
   - Verify NSG rules correctly reference the ASGs
   - Check that ASGs are in the same region as the resources they're applied to

3. **Service Tag Issues:**
   - Ensure you're using the correct service tag for your scenario
   - Verify the service tag is correctly specified in the rule

4. **Connectivity Issues:**
   - Use Network Watcher's IP flow verify tool to check if traffic is allowed/denied
   - Check effective security rules on the network interface
   - Verify VM is running and network interfaces are properly configured
